                    <hr>
                    <p>THE YEAR 2017 SHALL BE TO YOU THE YEAR OF “THE MANIFESTATION OF JESUS CHRIST”

<p>God manifested Himself to the World by becoming flesh (John1:14) that those that receive Him might be made (John 1:12) a manifestation of Him to the World (1 John 1:2) “For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us”</p>

<p>A true believer is made by the Word and the Spirit to become a manifestation of Jesus Christ (Rom 8:29) “For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren”</p> 

<p>Jesus is made unto us sin that we might manifest His Righteousness (2 Cor 5:21), He is made unto us Poverty that we might manifest His prosperity (2 Cor 8:9), He is made unto us Death that we might manifest his life, (1 John 5:12; Rom 6:9-11) He is made unto us fear that we might manifest his Power and Dominion, (2 Tim 1:7; Heb 2:15; 13:5-6; 1 John 4:18) He is made unto us Foolishness That we might manifest his Wisdom, (1 Cor 1:18-25; 2 Cor 2:14) He is made unto us Hatred and Shame that we might manifest his Love, (Eph 1:6; Rom 9:25; 1 Cor 1:26-28)  he is made unto us all things that made us a spectacle of failure and rejection that we might be made the epitome of His Success and acceptance into the beloved (Isa 53:3-11).</p>

<p>Now we can boldly say,</p> 
<p>“I am a manifestation of the Righteousness of Jesus Christ”</p>
<p>“I am a manifestation of the Dominion of Jesus Christ”</p>
<p>“I am a manifestation of the Love of Jesus Christ”</p>
<p>“I am a manifestation of the Power of Jesus Christ”</p>
<p>“I am a manifestation of the Prosperity of Jesus Christ”</p>
<p>“I am a manifestation of the Life of Jesus Christ”</p> 
<p>“I am a manifestation of the Faith of Jesus Christ”</p>
<p>“I am a manifestation of the Excellence of Jesus Christ”</p>

<p>Jesus was a minister of Life by the Spirit (John 6:63) “It is the spirit that giveth life; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. (1 Cor 15:45) “…the last Adam (Jesus Christ) was made a life Giving Spirit” You manifesting Jesus Christ is you becoming a minister of Life, a life giving Spirit (2 Cor 3:6) “who also hath made us able Ministers of the new testament; not of the letter but of the Spirit: for the Letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life”</p>

<p>I declare that in 2017 you shall indeed be a manifestation of Jesus Christ; the Zoe life of Christ will flow into everything you do! You shall minister Life by the Spirit of God, Jesus said ‘if you believe the works that I do you shall do also and greater works shall you do’ the year 2017 shall be to you a year of greater works indeed in Jesus name! if God has done great things in your life, in the year 2017 what he did in your life from birth will be as nothing compared to what he will do in the year 2017 in Jesus name! Shalom!</p>
